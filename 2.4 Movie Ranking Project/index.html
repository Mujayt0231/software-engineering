<h1>The Best Movies According to Mujayit</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>It's one of the best sci-fi movies ever made PERIOD</p>

<h3>Life of Pi</h3>
<p>The storyline of the movie seems simple, and fictional, but it contains infinite amount of meaning like it's name Pi
</p>

<h3>Ex-machina</h3>
<p>The movie wonderfully encapsulate the fear of AI</p>
